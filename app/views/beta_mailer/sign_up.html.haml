    %h1 Thanks for signing up for a beta invite to BetterSheet.com
    
    %p 
      We're working on making a better way to manage cost for construction projects;
      We'll send you an email when we're ready to start
      
    %p
      Since we're still in the early stages of development, this is a great time
      for you to influence what features we build first.  Do you have specific needs
      that BetterSheet can help you resolve?
